  This directory contains some additional stuff for rc/akanga.

  rdk		Two functions to simplify the development of rc/akanga
  		functions.  It must be loaded with the ``.'' command:

		  . rdk

		This defines two functions:

		  edit [<file>]		loads <file> into your text editor.
		  			If you finish editing the edit
					function tries to determine if the
					contents of <file> can be loaded into
					the rc shell.  If yes it asks if you
					want to reload the contents of <file>
					with the ``.'' command otherwise it
					asks if you want to reedit <file>.

		  load [<var>] <file>	is used internally by edit.

		The intended purpose of the edit function is to speed up the
		'edit file, load file, "oh, another error"' cycle when I'm
		editing functions.
		rdk makes use of the mktemp builtin found only in akanga,
		but not in rc.

  rc-environ	A sample .rcrc file.
  
  passwdgen	An awk script that generates passwords that are
  		almost readable.
