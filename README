Version 1.0.7
- -----------

  * expr, let: strftime() and systime() are new.

  * expr, let: argc() return the number of command line arguments
    and argv(x) returns the xth argument.

  * mktemp: The variable $tmpprefix can set a common prefix to all
    filenames that are generated with mktemp.  Do a

    	let 'timprefix = systime() ^ "." ^ pid'

    to get guarented unique filenames.

  * passwdgen: Altough not an akanga script it' now also installed
    under /usr/local/bin because there are other akanga scripts
    where it's useful to have this utility.  Notice that there is
    no manpage for it.
    It's function is simple: for each input line you get an almost
    pronouncable password.  You can specify a command line parameter
    to control the length of the passwords (default is 4 units).

  * expr, let: seq() didn't work for negative increments.  Now you
    can do a

    	; expr 'seq(1, 8, -2)'


Version 1.0.6
- -----------

  * The only thing I added is the -s switch to the initvars command to
    force the value assignment.

  * There was a bug in the expression evaluation.


Version 1.0.5
- -----------

  * What is akanga?
    akanga is a rc derived shell interpreter.  It was developed from the
    release rc-1.5betadev.  akanga is also preconfigured for editline
    support and comes with the sorces for it.


  * What is the difference between rc and akanga?
    akanga has additional builtin support for

      - Temporary files
      - File locking
      - Reading standard input
      - Reading configuration files
      - Arithmetic expression evaluation

    They are meant to support better programming support.  See akanga(1)
    and akangaexpr(1) for further information.


  * How do I compile it?
    You can try a ``make'' in the main directory.  This will produce
    a good number of compilation messages.  Ignore them if you don't
    get errors.  If it works you'll get the stripped akanga binary in
    the bin directory.   Copy it to /bin.


  * Installing akanga and samples.
    The makefile contains an ``install'' target that copies akanga
    to /bin the sample scripts to /usr/local/bin and all available
    manpages to /usr/local/man/man1.  You can change the locations
    in ``copyfiles'' script.
    This requires a compiled akanga binary in the bin directory.


  * How do I use it?
    The samples directory contains some example script for akanga.
